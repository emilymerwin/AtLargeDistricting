#At-large districting
- Goes with story about how electing representatives at-large vs by district tends to prevent black voters from being able to elect representative of their choice. Explores relationship between race and representation by county and their system.

##Setup

###ToDo
- [ ] Highlight relevent table columns when selecting a filter, or hide the irrelevant ones
